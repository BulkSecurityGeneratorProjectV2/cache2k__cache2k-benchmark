/**
 * This package is essentially a snapshot of the end of 2015 implementation state of cache2k.
 * The purpose of this is to have an archived version of the different replacement algorithms
 * implemented (LRU, ARC, CAR, Clock, etc.). These algorithms will be removed from the
 * official cache2k version.
